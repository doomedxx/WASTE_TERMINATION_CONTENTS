This tool generates bitmaps from system fonts which can be converted for use
in Doom engines supporting zdoom-style "font lumps" by using a utility called
"imagetool". Imagetool is now included with this program. 

Please read license.txt and the third-party licenses in ./doc .

Run the "doomfontgen" command from this directory to get started.  


Note to linux users
===================
You will need to have the ImageMagick "convert" command available in your path 
or in ./util . You will also need wine installed if you want to run imagetool.
