Edit bigfont.charmap and confont.charmap to use 
these as your custom font character sets.

Copy the contents of the .sample files over if you 
don't want to start from scratch.

DO NOT DELETE bigfont.charmap or confont.charmap, 
as this will cause annoying error messages. If you 
don't want to use custom character sets, leave the 
files blank and default character sets will be used.
