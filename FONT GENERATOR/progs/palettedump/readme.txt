Spidey's Palette Dump Tool (palettedump)

This tool generates a palette (colormap) file based on an image.

The source image should be square, and both of its sides should
measure a power of two (ie 64, 128, 256...) It should contain 256 
colored squares representing the color of each palette entry. 
The colors are entered into the palette in the order the squares
appear, starting at the upper left corner and moving from left to 
right, top to bottom.

This is an open-source project. See license.txt for details.

Run the "palettedump" command from this directory to get started.
